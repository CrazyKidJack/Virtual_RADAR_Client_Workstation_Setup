**FAQ:**

**TROUBLESHOOTING**
Most of your questions and troubleshooting can be addressed via typing “HELP” into the first page that pops up. If not, report issues here: https://github.com/KSanders7070/Virtual_RADAR_Client_Workstation_Setup/issues

**TEAMSPEAK**
I have no interest in coding an option for TeamSpeak. It is an old, ugly, and limited voice-comm software. I invite you to join us in 2021+.

**VATSYS and other RADAR Clients**
The ability to launch other RADAR Clients may be a future release.

**BETTER USER INTERFACE**
That is a lot of work. I welcome someone to use my concept to create a better UI-Based program.
